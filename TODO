  1. Add a client example

  2. Currently, a 2-member quorom won't re-establish until a 3rd node is brought online and all nodes reconverge.

  3. Add a smoke test on each converge:  [ https://github.com/phunt/zk-smoketest ]

  4. Look at adding ZK monitoring:

     a. Ganglia: ``src/contrib/monitoring/ganglia/zookeeper_ganglia.py``

        i. See: [ https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/tree/trunk/src/contrib/monitoring ]

     b. Python API: ``contrib/zkpython`` or ``src/contrib/zkpython``

        i. See zkTop or zookeeper_dashboard for an example: [ https://github.com/phunt/zktop ] or [ https://github.com/phunt/zookeeper_dashboard ]

     c. 4-Letter Words or JMX
